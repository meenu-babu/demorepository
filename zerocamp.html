        <h4>General FAQ</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>How can I contribute to Zerocamp?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          See the contributing guide here:<a
            href=" https://github.com/Zer0Camp/.github/blob/main/profile/contributing.md"

        <ul>
          <li>Why is this program free?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This is a not-for-profit volunteer-run initiative by volunteers to
          contribute back to society and solve the unemployment and skill gap
          issues in tech.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>How do you plan to expand?</li>
          <p>
            The Bootcamp is entirely free for students. Once a student completes
            the course and lands a job, they can replicate the program on their
            own and mentor the next batch of students. This is not mandatory and
            completely voluntary. Even if 50% of students completing the course
            give back in this manner, the potential for growth is exponential.
          </p>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>Why is the curriculum open source?</li>
          <p>
            Our mission is to revolutionize the tech industry by solving the
            skill gap and unemployment issues. We would like to see our model
            replicated by others and everyone is encouraged to use, modify, or
            distribute our resources and boot camp program. Currently, we are
            working on adding weekly study modules to our curriculum GitHub repo
          </p>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>What is open startup philosophy?</li>
          <p>
            Open startups share their metrics and operational details (such as
            financials & revenues) and aim to be as transparent as possible.
            Zerocamp follows this philosophy so that anyone can see, improve,
            adapt, and replicate our modes of operation.
          </p>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>Are you an alternative to X/Y bootcamp?</li>
          <p>
            Zerocamp is an alternative approach to coding education. We believe
            everyone has their own place and there are a number of other
            bootcamps with well-established curriculums, individual attention to
            students, and more hiring partnerships. Zerocampâ€™s aim is to
            democratize coding education and prevent entry barriers in tech.
            Students can join Zerocamp without worrying about any fees or
            payments, the only requirement is a willingness to learn.
          </p>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>Is Zerocamp a registered company</li>
          <p>
            Currently, Zerocamp is not a registered company. We plan to register
            it as a nonprofit org within a few months.
          </p>

      <div class="student-faq">
        <ul>
          <li>Do I need to pay anything once I get a job?</li>
          <p>
            No, the program is fully free. Once you land a job, you may choose
            to give back by mentoring the next cohort of students.
          </p>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>What languages/tech will I Learn?</li>
          <p>
            Zerocamp curriculum will cover backend development using Python and
            frontend using Javascript.
          </p>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>How is the program structured?</li>
          <p>
            The program follows a self-study approach. We will give students a
            list of weekly topics to learn along with recommended resources
            (online courses, articles, YouTube videos, etc.). After each week,
            students will have a call with a mentor who will assess the learning
            and provide suggestions for improvement. Daily collaborative
            learning - We plan to set up daily sync calls with all students in
            the program each day so that they can discuss their learning and
            grow together. Toward the end of the program, students will work on
            real-world projects and will have mock interview sessions to make
            them job-ready.
          </p>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>When will the program start?</li>
          <p>
            The program will start in mid-September and will span 3-4 months.
          </p>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>
            How many hours do I need to dedicate to this? Can I do this
            part-time?
          </li>
          <p>
            The current program requires a full-time contribution from your end.
            Once we grow, we can plan for another version of Zerocamp which can
            be done part-time.
          </p>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>Do you guarantee a job after completion of this course?</li>
          <p>
            Though we do everything in our power to place you in a job, we
            cannot guarantee this. The number of open jobs at any time can be
            impacted by various factors. We are actively looking to partner with
            tech companies to make it easier for students to land a job. Along
            with this, once you complete the course, you are encouraged to apply
            to open jobs via other career platforms. We will help you with
            resources to ace job searches and interviews and will provide you
            with mock interviews. We (zerocamp volunteers) were involved in
            hiring many fresher engineers to our teams and we can assure you
            that we will do everything we can to elevate you as an ideal
            candidate for any junior roles, provided you are enthusiastic about
            learning tech.
          </p>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>How long will be this program?</li>
          <p>
            The course will require you to dedicate 3-4 months to cover the
            entire curriculum and build some portfolio projects. After the
            initial 3 months, we encourage you to start a job search and will
            help you by setting up interviews with our hiring partners.

            What are your qualifications to offer this program/mentorship? How
            do you select the learning resources?
          </li>
          <p>
            We (zerocamp volunteers) have experience building world-class
            products and are aware of the essential skills we look for in junior
            engineers. The curriculum is being built based on popular MOOCs,
            programming books, or other free courses which have been positively
            reviewed by students all around the globe.
